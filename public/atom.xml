I wrote this paper as a course paper in sustainability and innovation at the University of Oslo. In the section before the conclusion I propose an original (possibly not, but I didn&amp;#39;t find it elsewhere) system for coordinating government agreements around international policy.

Abstract
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Climate change presents a pressing range of tragedy of the commons problems, eg. global sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Barring the reduction of democracy to technocracy, there is a niche for innovation in the methodology employed by political bodies toward assessing solution quality and the probable outcome landscape of implementing a policy or resolution. Multilateral policy agendas coordinated between political actors represents one such opportunity. Attempts at collective action solutions often result in the emergence of tragedy-of-the-commons problems. I will analyze the tragedy-of-the-commons failure as pertaining to international climate summit resolutions, and introduce several implementations of prediction markets as a possible solution to the problems incumbent to global climate agreements, and tragedy-of-the-commons problems more generally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Introduction
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Global climate summits an example of the tragedy-of-the-commons problem: political actors employ the ecopragmatist-originated sustainable transformation rhetoric as umbrage for resolution-reneging political failures, while the political incentive to meet international climate summit commitments is regularly outweighed by competing local political factors. Incentivizing multilateral follow-through on climate agreements requires addressing several sub-problems.
I will address and analyze the problems incumbent to the present system of climate resolution. Then I explore technocracy as a naive solution to the political problem of information aggregation. Then I will introduce prediction markets, applied to these problems in two possible implementations. Last, I will discuss some of the more common criticisms with prediction markets.
&lt;/p&gt;

Criticisms of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and SDGs [a], adopted in 2015 by the UN, outlines 17 goals and 169 targets for reducing poverty and engaging sustainable practices in participating nations. One might infer from the self-congratulatory language used on the website of the European Union that the Agenda’s success is all but assured: “the adoption of the 2030 Agenda was a landmark achievement, providing for a shared global vision towards sustainable development for all.” Claims to the contrary are in evidence.
425 days after the adoption of the Agenda (in 2016),  “tangible progress in terms of implementing the SDGs at the country level has been hard to come by” [c], and in the 2019 SDG report, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres wrote “it is abundantly clear that a much deeper, faster and more ambitious response is needed to unleash the social and economic transformation needed to achieve our 2030 goals” [d].
One obvious problem is the excessive use of vague language in the agenda’s goals, eg. “3. Good Health and Well-Being for people– Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”, in combination with ludicrously overzealous goals, eg. “1. No Poverty-End poverty in all its forms everywhere.” A child might have written these. For these among other reasons, the SDG goals were called “worse than useless” by The Economist in 2015 [b]. The document continues “All countries have a shared responsibility to achieve the SDGs.” To clarify: the term “shared responsibility” is political umbrage, indicative of no responsibility at all. Political leaders’ motives at summits such as these are not to acquire the relevant information, assemble coherent policy agendas, or otherwise solve any problems at all, but to author rhetorical nonsense, while pretending to be doing something.
A better system for aggregating the relevant information and constructing coherent policy agendas is in need. Before proposing an alternative, I analyze some of the problems inherent to the present system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
Problems Inherent to International Policy Consensus
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Three key problems emerge in the UN methodology in designing and implementing goals. The first has to do with the distributed nature of responsibility for implementing policy, resulting in a tragedy-of-the-commons problem. The second has to do with the existing processes by which existing information is aggregated into resolutions and policies. The last has to do with the reporting and accountability process, after resolutions and policies are put in place.
The distributed nature of responsibility among United Nations member nations decreases the degree of accountability any particular nation holds in following through on its commitments, eg. As member countries A and B commit to reducing it’s net carbon footprint, country B benefits from country A reducing its carbon footprint, but pays none of the costs incurred by decreasing country B’s own footprint. Thus country B has incentive to renege on its agreements while saddling country A with the costs. The scale of the problem increases with the number of countries, and their relative power differential. For instance, in our previous example, if country B is economically or militarily dependent on country A, country A has further less incentive to sacrifice immediate economic productivity to satisfy an international agreement. This puts weak nations in an impossible political situation, as Leichenko and Silva identify that “not only are the poorest and most marginalized disproportionately affected, but climate change impacts can also exacerbate existing inequalities” [e]. Note that country A may still enter an agreement with no intention of holding to it, so as to enjoy the benefits of other nations’ carbon footprint reduction while paying none of the costs. This provides context for how all 193 of the member countries of the United Nations committed to the SDG agenda, while funding for achieving these goals is 2.5 trillion dollars short of the 5 trillion per annum price tag [f]. The incentive to defect from agreements is a hallmark of the Tragedy-of-the-Commons problem. Holding to the international agreement is in direct competition with satisfying interest groups, promoting economic activity, and securing local objectives.
Solving tragedy-of-the-commons problems requires optimization in selecting realistically limited objectives, implementing effective policy to resolve those objectives, and measuring results.
Beginning with rational information acquisition, we may ask the question, how well informed with respect to realistic outcomes is current policy? Given that only 2 of the 17 SDG goals are currently on track, it seems safe to conclude: not very. This is a characteristic property of democracy: from the local to the international, voters have little chance to be pivotal in voting, irrational in selecting realistic policy paths, under-informed in policy relevant to them, and tribal in their ultimate policy preference.  Their representative politicians, responsible to their constituents, reflect these failures in information aggregation. In this system, relevant information for policy selection is regularly subverted to tribal preference, miscommunicated by media, deprioritized on the basis of technicality, or never brought to light in the first place. The result is the commitment toward ineffective and unrealistic solutions, as in the case of the 17 SDGs. As the power for humans to effect changes on our environment monotonically increases with time, political systems incorporating such failures as these doom the quality of our political decisions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
Naive Solution: Technocracy
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The most naive solution to the criticisms above, in particular with regards to climate action as a primarily scientific and economic domain of policy, would be to simply reduce the poIr of our representative democracy with respect to policy decisions inside certain domains, reallocating the poIr to shape policy to the set of experts perceived to be most relevant. Political systems in this arrangement are referred to as technocracies, and emerge commonly in businesses requiring technical expertise. Though a full analysis of the merits and weaknesses of technocracy is beyond the scope of this paper, a brief treatment of the most relevant problems of technocracy will prepare the ground for prediction markets.
Technocracy’s primary advantage in practice is an approximation of meritocracy flavored towards elevating the hierarchical importance of fact-based reasoning and technical ability to engage a somewhat predefined domain of technical problems.
The first problem in technocracy one might encounter is a problem with the very definition of what constitutes an “acceptable group of relevant experts.” Each word presents myriad problems. Acceptable to whom? Being acceptable to the public reduces our group of experts to little more than politicians. Being acceptable to other experts (if such a group even exists) exposes age bias, and is still vulnerable to a certain degree of politicking. Does relevant indicate the group should represent a sampling of interdisciplinary fields or should it be more constrained? Should the group’s participants be a dynamic set or a static one? What about overlapping expertise groups? This is to demonstrate that the problem of electing a set of experts in a democracy is quickly reduced to the problem electing politicians. Were it politically popular to elect expects, such would already be the status quo.
Even presupposing a mechanism for expert committee selection, a second class of political problem exists: technocracies are aristocracies with a chrome polish. That is, technocracies are closed political systems; once established, members of a technocracy could gate-keep even other experts out of the technocracy. This is acceptable in business, where gatekeeping takes the form of filtering new hires, but not in government, where a political near-invulnerability to criticism is unacceptable.
Finally, the problem domains in which technocracies thrive often allow for the opportunity for a posteriori improvements to solutions. Political environments are hostile to iterative policy change; that is, the cost of renegotiating policy decisions is high. Further, there are economic productivity losses in volatile policy environments. Thus policy technocracies are subject to the same constraint restriction of the existing democratic system: policy construction must optimally aggregate the available information landscape while navigating the political network. This implies that the information aggregation problem exists in isolation to the chosen political regime, suggesting that there may be better solutions to the problem of information aggregation with respect to the construction of policy decisions than resorting to a cabal of politically unaccountable domain experts.
Prediction Markets in Assessing Policy Directions
To my best knowledge, prediction markets were introduced as having potential as a democratic process by economist Robert Hanson [g]. Hanson proposed that “inferior policies happen because our info institutions fail to induce people to acquire and share relevant info with properly-motivated decision makers.” Hanson identified inferior processes for generating and evaluating information relevant to governing as responsible for economic divergence between democracies, and proposed prediction markets as a solution. Prediction markets are effective at aggregating information about the probable outcomes of a proposed action. By their application to policy, nations may optimize policy selection, while resolving an incentive mechanism to counteract the tragedy-of-the-commons problem. Note that the ability of prediction markets is limited to expressing probable outcomes of policy alternatives, not in expressing what outcomes are qualitatively better than one another.
Participants in a prediction market bet on the outcome of a particular event by an agreed upon point in time. For example, suppose at time t=0, a prediction market opens around whether policy A will achieve event Z by time t=T. Bettor 0 believes the outcome is likely, and bets $70. Then at time t=1, bettor 1 believes the outcome is only 70% likely to occur, so bettor 5 bets $30 against. The betting market now reflects a 70% chance of action success. If no further bettors enter, and the result is positive, the first seven bettors split the $30 counterbet, and if the result is negative, bettor 1 takes the $70. But now suppose an alleged domain expert, bettor 2, sees the 70% betting odds, and thinks the odds are much closer to 40%. If bettor 2 is correct, he will profit off of making any bet moving the odds closer to 40%. He does so by betting $75 against. The prediction market thereby incentivizes all domain experts, regardless of credentialing, to apply their knowledge for the public interest. This system avoids the closed property of technocracies’ only allowing for the expressed opinions of a narrow, preselected group of experts, while simultaneously allowing for democracy to take place around the most engaged, informed, and affected constituents. Statistics reflect this: in one study, prediction markets around elections were found to be 74% more effective than polling over 964 elections, with an even greater advantage in forecasts beyond 100 days [h].
In the context of policy selection, a political committee could propose several policy alternatives to a betting market in reference to their ability to achieve some outcome.  After some waiting period (requiring some mechanism to avoid allowing last minute interference bets), the committee could then implement the policy alternative seen as most likely to succeed, and reset all markets of policy alternatives not taken.
One of the most common criticisms of prediction markets as a vector to inform policy decisions is the opportunity for interest groups to tip the scale by betting overwhelmingly in their preferred direction. But placing restrictions on the maximum bet should not be necessary. The event of an interest group betting tremendously in one direction should be seen as a tremendous arbitrage opportunity for prediction market participants, as the interest group is not strictly buying “votes” per se, but expressing an opinion concerning the likelihood of an outcome. For instance, if a petroleum company sought to sabotage a prediction market around the probability that policy A achieves outcome Z by betting overwhelmingly that an alternative policy B achieves outcome Z better than policy A, bettors are incentivized to take the counter-bet of petroleum company on policy B, reaping an arbitrage opportunity. This is because bets are not votes: votes are expressions of preference (which deserve discussion in a paper in their own right), bets are expressions of belief about the state of the world, and the consequences of a given action.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
Prediction Markets as Staking Mechanisms
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bets are mechanisms for forcing alignment between beliefs and actions. Among the problems inherent to the tragedy-of-the-commons is that actors are incentivized to lie about intentions, or to otherwise express under-calibrated opinions. In addition to their role in information aggregation, prediction markets can serve a mechanism for constructing stake in international policy agreements.
A staking mechanism is a procedure in which a participating party accept some quantity of risk, for one or more of the following purposes: (i) as collateral against the party to breaking agreements, (ii) as a signaling mechanism intended to encourage further action by other parties, ie. the public, (iii) as a substitute for, or complement to reputation, in systems where reputation is insufficient in one of the two above ways, (iv) as a bet on a particular outcome with some probability and expectation of returns with positive expected value (v) from the perspective of an observer to the staking process, a mechanism for collecting information about the belief state of participants in the staking system. All but definition (iv) are directly relevant to the discussion of inducing actors to commit to and engage in a more desirable set of actions, in particular, with respect to preserving the environment among other desirable outcomes.
A proposed system for international politics could proceed as follows: First, a desired outcome is determined, for instance, a k% reduction in carbon footprint by each nation within 3 years, where each nation gets to choose their value for k, but exponentially increasing upfront costs to a nation’s choice of k below some value. Nations would be required to bet some minimum percentage of their GDP as stake toward meeting their target. Finally, delegates from each nation would proceed to place bets on each other nation’s objective being met with and against that nation’s staked bet.
This system has several advantages. First, it avoids a one-size-fits-all problem of international politics: policy that is effective or reasonable in one nation may not at all be in another. By calibrating goals with respect to each nation, we avoid the problems inherent to the SDG goals’ being simultaneously vague and exaggerated.
Second, if nation A’s delegates bet that nation B succeeds at meeting its policy goal, nation A is incentivized to pressure and assist nation B in meeting that policy goal, fostering international cooperation, rather than creating opportunity for defection from agenda agreements.
Third, the process creates a reasonably interesting opportunity for popular engagement in international politics. An international betting market between nations would be the international policy equivalent of the Olympics, and would likely draw a great deal of popular attention, raising the stakes for failing to meet commitments.
&lt;/p&gt;

Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have analyzed several problems with the international political process, embodied in the 2015 SDGs, and proposed two possible implementations of prediction markets as solutions for rationally aggregating information. I introduced technocracy as a toy solution to better information aggregation, and explored the undesirable properties inherent to that solution as an alternative for eliminating the irrationality inherent to democratic processes. I aimed to attempt to solve the tragedy-of-the-commons problem emergent in international politics, while identifying the economic mechanism failures of the existing process.

                <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;
23 books, 3 unfinished with no intention to finish anytime soon.
5 fiction, 18 nonfiction (would it be cheeky to count The Little Bitcoin Book as fiction?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Trends:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
non-fiction especially about business, identity, and climate science early on
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Biographies and Neal Stephenson towards the end
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll give a couple sentences of my thoughts about each book and a rating out of 10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-1&#34;&gt;
The books:
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Climate and Society, Robin Leinchenko and Karen O&amp;#39;Brien
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Information sparse, introduces the integrative approach to climate change solutions. Well researched, useful to get a bearing on the complexity of proposing a &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; to climate change, but prolix. 7/10
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
The Ecology of Commerce, Paul Hawken, unfinished
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hawken is an ecological warrior whose writing should be dated given its publication date of 1992, yet one could rewrite the book today with few changes. Lends support to the conclusion that the environment is doomed and our static political systems are to blame. Unfinished because the book is repetitive. 6/10
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
The End of Jobs, Taylor Pearson
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 4 hour work week, but 10 years later and less interesting. Was interested in his blog, not polished or content dense enough to justify a book. 3/10
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-5&#34;&gt;
What You Do is Who You Are, Ben Horowitz
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Great read on values, stories about vivid figures from history who demonstrate values in motion, which Horowitz terms &amp;#34;virtues&amp;#34;, borrowed from samurai literature. Less interested in the business anecdotes, but Horowitz is all around a great story teller. May reread. 9/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-6&#34;&gt;
A Liberated Mind, Steven C. Hayes
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hayes is the father of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. All the feely goody bubbly nonsense anecdotes therapy is infamous for, but not without a complete lack of substance–Hayes delivers the principles of ACT effectively, despite himself. 7/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-7&#34;&gt;
Sapiens, A Brief History of Humankind, Yuval Noah Harari
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overrated, but not by much. Seemed like a good thing to read to kids, if I had any. 8/10
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-8&#34;&gt;
The Hard Thing about Hard Things, Ben Horowitz, reread
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reread after WYDiWYD. Hard thing about hard things is, as with the next book, about taking the hard things in your hands, communicating honesty in business and in life. Horowitz weaves lessons into the story of his time as CEO of Loudcloud, and a great storyteller he is. 9/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-9&#34;&gt;
Models, Attract Women Through Honesty, Mark Manson
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An exploration of masculinity, an area of conversation I find underrated, possibly because it only seems to happen when men talk about dating. Book cogently delivers on its premise, investigating the particulars of holding honest as a value, and using it to connect with others (including women). 9/10
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-10&#34;&gt;
Homo Deus, Yuval Noah Harari, unfinished
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Worse than Sapiens due to a greater degree of speculation. Harari is more in his element in 21 Lessons and Sapiens. Was often bored. 6/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-11&#34;&gt;
Range, Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World, David Epstein
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book and the next fall into my &amp;#34;standard MBA business book&amp;#34; category, delivering loosely connected anecdotes and studies as defenses of an over-general principle. Barely managed to finish each of them. This one did it better. I&amp;#39;m squarely in the target audience for each and was constantly bored. 6/10.
Rebel Talent, Why it Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life, Francesca Gino
5/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-12&#34;&gt;
Tribe, On Homecoming and Belonging, Sebastian Junger, reread
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Junger&amp;#39;s message in Tribe is clearer than Lake Tahoe, and timeless as her mountains. Conciseness is underrated; Junger delivers in 180 short pages several well constructed narratives highlighting our separation from one another, and how we may come together again. 10/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-13&#34;&gt;
Talking to Strangers, Malcolm Gladwell
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Depressingly the opposite of the above. Gladwell&amp;#39;s winding narrative style is acceptable when he has more to say. He remains an excellent, if somewhat roundabout narrator. I found the premise–that we underrate the value of context and overrate the importance of identity–uninspiring. 7/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-14&#34;&gt;
Words and Rules, Steven Pinker, unfinished
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A book only a linguist could love, or finish. Long, thorough, and by the sixth chapter, too systematic for even a man with Aspergers. 6/10
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-15&#34;&gt;
The Little Bitcoin Book, The Bitcoin Collective
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Useful in offering the Bitcoin maximalist system of the world. I&amp;#39;d wanted to get a better idea of what this system of the world was, and especially found it in chapter 5, which offers a pair of speculative anecdotes of the world in 2030 with and without decentralized currency. Conciseness is good. 9/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-16&#34;&gt;
Emmy in the Key of Code, Aimee Lucido
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What a delightful and unusual children&amp;#39;s book this is, discovered through the Embedded.fm podcast. A collection of poems from the perspective of a musical child struggling to find herself in a new place. Struggles with chauvinism, self discovery, appeals to the similarity of code and poetry, musical references, and an utter delight. 10/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-17&#34;&gt;
Hackers and Painters, Paul Graham, reread
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The best collection of essays I&amp;#39;ve ever read on what it is to be a hacker, beyond the obvious: we make stuff. The first chapter, about the quality of education (despite my general agreement with most of the premises), was arguably the worst. The remainder of the book is a welcome investigation into value, hacking, and what it is to be a technologist, without fear of delving deep. 10/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-18&#34;&gt;
King Lear, &amp;#39;ol Bill Shakespeare
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unrateable: a low rating marks me as uncultured swine, and a high rating suggests a mastery of Shakespeare I am yet to attain. I continue to find reading Shakespeare as challenging and worthwhile a literary exercise as the best mathematical exercise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-19&#34;&gt;
Elon Musk, Ashlee Vance, reread
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reread this biography a few months after the more recent controversies of Musk&amp;#39;s making an ass out of himself to see if I still resonate with his story and self image as a man possessed to make an impact in the world. I do. It&amp;#39;s interesting that he seems content to piss off people so much, something I feel I nearly understand, but just somehow miss. The biography is excellent, and makes me want to defend him. It also makes me want to be like him, which I&amp;#39;m only somewhat uncomfortable with. 10/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-20&#34;&gt;
Steve Jobs, Walter Isaacson
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wanted to compare the Musk biography to another pivotal figure, who exists in the same strata of obscenely multitalented entrepreneur defining and propelling the boundary of technology. I&amp;#39;m unsure if it&amp;#39;s simply a testament to Vance&amp;#39;s ability as a biographer, or if I simply resonate more deeply with the Musk story, but I came away from the Jobs biography with a certain, &amp;#34;why do I care again?&amp;#34; taste in my mouth. The early half of the book felt more alive. Maybe this is my becoming a Wozniak fan. 7/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-21&#34;&gt;
Atmosphæra Incognita, Neal Stephenson
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Stephenson at his shortest. In 100 pages or so, Stephenson lets loose a short story of the tallest building mankind could ever construct. The story appears to be an allegory for technology, progressively hoisting mankind to uncharted heights, with newfound danger and excitement at each new level. I can&amp;#39;t stop reading Stephenson after this. 10/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-22&#34;&gt;
The Diamond Age, Neal Stephenson
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Snow Crash (read in December) was fantastic, but only periodically ran as deep as I would have liked. The Diamond Age scratches that itch. Stephenson trots out a gorgeous fragmented world replete with a new element: nanotechnology. Deftly exploring coming of age, what it means to be a hypocrite, moral life in a corrupt society, the education of a subversive, and the difference of having everything one needs and having everything one needs to build that which one needs, I&amp;#39;m captured with The Diamond Age world, and its protagonist. 10/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;headline-23&#34;&gt;
Anathem, Neal Stephenson
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I wanted The Diamond Age to be Stephenson at his best. I wanted to think, alright, I can stop reading Stephenson now. I especially wanted to avoid reading 2700 pages of the Baroque cycle. But after this, I think I&amp;#39;m doomed to read everything Stephenson ever wrote. I&amp;#39;m absolutely taken by the world building, the allegories to mathematics and technology, the incorporation of astronomical physics and the multiple worlds hypothesis, and of course, Neal Stephenson&amp;#39;s uncanny ability to bring his characters to life. 10/10.
&lt;/p&gt;

Review
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rating: 7/10* (9/10 for the first six chapters)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AI Superpowers is an China-optimistic perspective from a Chinese
venture capitalist on the state of advancing competition between China and the
rest of the world, which one might (understandably) believe was only Silicon
Valley after having read this book. In the first several chapters, Lee sets up a
framework to defend his optimism for Chinese firms potential to compete in
artificial intelligence by contrasting Chinese entrepreneurial culture to
Silicon Valley’s, and drawing stark contrasts between American and Chinese
governments approaches to their respective technology industries. Some of Lee’s
claims require scrutiny, including his bolstering for Chinese government,
borderline-advocacy of ruthless business practice, and characterization that
Silicon Valley is pitting elite researchers against Chinese good-enough
engineers. However, the book is an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to
gain better understanding of how entrepreneurship operates in China, and how the
rising Chinese technology economy may overwhelm expectations as an unprecedented
powerhouse in emerging technology areas. My interest I suspect the emergence of China as a
technological superpower bodes ill as a spectre of things to come with regards
to the Chinese reputation of undermining humanism and political freedoms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lee’s deconstruction of AI as a field is most comprehensive in the middle of the
book. Lee gives a careful analysis of the four application “waves” of Artificial
Intelligence, in considering those that Chinese firms will be most competitive
in. He weighs questions about “grid” versus “battery” approaches to artificial
intelligence. Championing for the Chinese government’s inefficient, yet clear,
approach to stimulating growth with massive incentives, and invasive data
collection practices, Lee’s analyses are sometimes poetic, but always
optimistic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the last half of the book, Lee (rather abruptly) changes topic. His close
encounter with cancer drives him to climb a mountain, to talk to a monk, to
celebrate a volunteer golf cart driver, and finally present his thesis on how AI
tech has the capacity to displace whole societies. His last two chapters
describe what we as a society might do to limit the negative consequences of
what will be gradual but massive displacement and unemployment. Though I&amp;#39;m
persuaded that society will undergo a massive displacement, Lee&amp;#39;s newfound
enlightenment in how to reorganize a post-work society were underwhelming at
best, or as I feel is more likely, merely insincere poetry. He proposes a new
culture code for society, around the principles of human love, service, and
compassion, over present imperatives to find productivity. His transformation
story, both for himself and for society land a bit clumsily: his personal
transformation from human-turned-work-algorithm to friend and teacher read as an
abrupt turn: an out of place single chapter in the book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By the end of the book, I felt I had a plausible and detailed thesis for how
Chinese entrepreneurs might compete with their American counterparts. I
understood the advantages that Chinese businesses wield, and the role the
Chinese culture and government may play in that transition. The latter half of
the book read more clumsily. Lee’s arguments for how we may transform society to
avoid dramatic social upheaval were well considered, though less insightful, and
more castle-in-the-sky than his exposition on the Chinese technology story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headline-2&#34;&gt;
Rating
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First half (6 chapters): information dense enough for a 9/10.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Second half: often off topic, with a cancer story, an underdeveloped thesis for
post-work social change, punctuated with emotionally disingenuous personal
anecdotes. 5/10
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Total: 7/10
&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“The speed with which human rights has penetrated every corner of the globe is astounding. Compared to human rights, no other system of universal values has spread so far so fast…. In what amounts to a historical blink of the eye, the idea of human rights has become the lingua franca of international morality” (Normand 8). With the simultaneous rise of secularism and the middle class in colonial Europe in the 19th Century, so rose the need for the decoupling of moral justifications for imperialism from religious precedents. Human rights left the sacred behind as a construction of universal humanist norms, to inspire the support of a rising middle class in a modernizing Europe. By donning the vestiges of moral supremacy, Europeans gained new justification for civilizing, educating, and employing the next century of colonial labor, while stemming criticisms of the rising bourgeois class. Human rights have always been a farce, and they remain expensive moral umbrage for nations and the elite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The International Criminal Court, established in 2002, took ten years before its first successful prosecution, of Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. The cost of the ICC, in the first 10 years, exceeds 1 billion dollars. The major international criminal courts in aggregate exceed 6 billion dollars (Stuart 968). The United States, on whom much of the funding and legitimacy for international human rights relies, maintains immunity for its citizens by the 2002 American Service Members’ Protection Act. The rise of political rivals, most prominently Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, to American and European power, present a valid challenge to the underlying assumption embedded in the most basic premise of human rights: can human rights be truly universal, or are these simply the last vestiges of the once religious, now secular, hypocrite phoenix of moral supremacy? In an examination of the accomplishments of human rights through four eras, I’ll attempt to disentangle the self-aggrandizing mythos of human rights from reality.

1776-1947: Era of The Bourgeoisie, Secularism, and Capitalism
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The modern age of human rights very little resembles its prehistory. Democracies and autocracies, including monarchies, have vastly different requirements of their populations and legal frameworks. Democracies are held to higher standards of justification for political action. The overthrow of European monarchs marks one of the more productive eras in de-facto human rights development, though the language of human rights is mostly a post World War II invention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While difficult to quantify, one can reasonably hypothesize that the great advances of this era in human rights is the product of the success of popular uprisings, and the initial successes of expanding democracy, and its deceleration in the 20th century represents conflict of haves and have-nots: wealthy democratic countries have no more incentive than wealthy autocratic ones to preserve the human rights of other nations, especially when these rights conflict with at-home economic interests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the beginnings of the Age of Exploration, beginning with Portueguese navigators in the 15th and 16th Century, monarchs had little need of moral justification towards the end colonizing and enslaving. In the twin, unrivaled power structures of church and state, were generally sufficient justifications for expansion of empire in the name of God and country.  But the trappings of exploration produced rivals to the landed elite: the bourgeoisie, in whom the elites invested.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The British, with far-flung colonies and powerful shipping merchants bore witness to this. The Declaration of Independence, penned by American plantation owner Thomas Jefferson, is the product of the realization by American bourgeoisie that they possess sufficient wealth to contest, and even field armies against traditional monarchical power. Jefferson couches protestations towards monarchal Europe in proto-human rights declarations of offenses by the crown, violating “certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” The American Constitution re-affirms and cements the political rights of American citizens in The Bill of Rights albeit, excluding most of the population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Two decades later, revolutionaries in France mirror the American uprising, and take advantage of the financially drained Louis XVI to declare their rights as justification for revolution in The French Declaration of the Rights of Man. The age of the bourgeoisie, while still exclusionary to the vast majority of citizens, makes the beginnings of human rights discussion possible. But by this point in history, rights are not declared by top-down organizations and governments, but are the product of bottom-up uprisings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The year 1848, known as the Spring of Nations, brought a wave of popular uprisings across over 50 countries in Europe (Evans). The revolutions mostly aimed to overthrow monarchical power, while demanding democracy, freedom for the press, and rights for the working class. These rebellions were mostly secular: religious leaders traditionally worked in concert with monarchs suppress challenges to existing power structures. The revolutions succeeded to varying degrees at establishing democracies, but the agitation for a definitive set of rights, was impossible for elites to ignore. European humanist norms grew out of the revolutions, supporting the rights of the newly established bourgeois.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These rights would come under assault in the first half of the 20th Century. The twin cataclysms of the World Wars reduced Western Europe to rubble, allowing the advancing American economy to surpass its European forebears. The devastating effects of the world wars also propelled the advance of democracy and capitalism in Western Europe, and communist dictatorship in Eastern Europe. The positive narrative identifies this struggle as that of competing ideologies in a brawl of how best to assert the political and social rights against a Hobbsian struggle of all against all. The remaining powers needed new language to justify the shattered myths of the previous century, asserting that humanist rights existed, and could not be abused at any time by the existing power structures, as they had been in the world wars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It’s worth noting that each of the participants in the Second World War abused and repressed citizens in a major way. Though this list is hardly exhaustive: Jim Crow in the United States, colonial oppression by Western Powers, barbaric war crimes by the Japanese, and genocides by Nazis and Soviets. These were the powers submitting diplomats to pen the first modern document of Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). This stands in sharp contrast to the emergence of rights following popular uprisings in the 18th and 19th Centuries.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-3&#34;&gt;
1947-1976: Era of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the aftermath of the Second World war, world leaders gathered in Paris to pen the UDHR. According to international law professor Stephen Hopgood in The Endtimes of Human Rights, the UDHR was “an antidote to a troubling contradiction, the coexistence of progress with intensifying violence, vast social and economic inequality, and fears of “the disenchantment of the world” (Hopgood 1).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The modern language of human rights was borne out of the need for a neutral and secular ideology for developed nations to use as a neutered critique of one another, to limit risk of a third world war. European and American leaders sought to weave into the UDHR an ideological alibi for a new globalized economic system designed to promote international collaboration, benefitting the elites, while only supporting an enhanced sentimentality for human rights in tongue. The UDHR, therefore was a set of thirty non-binding articles, agreed upon by world leaders, but not to be taken seriously. Economist Eric Posner writes in The Twilight of Human Rights “the words in the Universal Declaration may have been stirring, but no one believed at the time that they portended a major change in the way international relations would be conducted, nor did they capture the imagination of voters, politicians, intellectuals, leaders of political movements, or anyone else who might have exerted political pressure on governments” (Posner 17).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why were the articles non-binding? The authors of the UDHR were not the surviving revolutionaries seeking to validate the rights of humans against their former governments, but the ambassadors of the most powerful nations, who sought to reaffirm their hegemonic power by a set of tacit agreements to not challenge one another militarily. These diplomats were not defending human rights in the sense that human rights protect people from their governments: they were protecting their nations, developed nations, from the threat of war. Any illusion of possible agreement concerning universal ideals was quickly dispelled: there were clashes between the United States diplomat, Elanor Roosevelt, with the Soviets concerning rights to property and political freedoms, opposition by the Saudis towards articles concerning freedom of religion, Latin American diplomats who wanted God mentioned, and fears of colonial intervention by the British and French, while the Japanese were to be stripped of their recent colonial acquisitions (Loeffler).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The effects of the UDHR on human rights around the world were underwhelming. The United Nations established a commission for responding to human rights complaints. In the first ten years of operation, roughly 65,000 letters alleging human rights violations arrived at this newly minted defender of human rights. The commission declined to investigate a single complaint (Loeffler). Issues emerged as larger powers did not want to risk upsetting the power balance between the Soviet Union and the United States, potentially triggering war, and smaller powers had neither the political capital, resources, nor incentive to begin investigations. The UDHR proved an empty set of nice sounding words. This was not unexpected, even at the outset: according to international law expert Hersch Laueterpacht in 1947, “to a lawyer, the enunciation of a right without the provision of a remedy is a judicial heresy…It is clear to me that the declaration does not carry things further and that in some important respects has put the clock back.” (Loeffler)

&lt;h3 id=&#34;headline-4&#34;&gt;
1976-1991: Era of Human Rights Treaty Proliferation and American Money
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The modern age of human rights organizations begins in earnest in the 1970s with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Moyn). The covenants were intended as an expansion of the UDHR, but this time, gave overseeing commissions more power to enforce violations. The covenants were contemplated as early as 1948, by American historian Arthur Holcombe, as “a project for a piece of international legislation, more ambitious and perhaps more important than any other in the history of international law. If supported by suitable measures of implementation, it could be a great triumph of reason over force and violence in the development of human relations.” (Holcombe, 413)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thus, the 1970s represent the shifting tide of human rights from general irrelevance to a proliferation of human rights treaties, to mixed effect. Some of these genuinely treated human rights issues, ie. Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), while others were microcosms of the symbolic battles between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States used human rights law as political leverage against the Soviet Union, while in exchange for ideological concessions, the Soviets bought recognition of autonomy in determining the freedoms of Eastern Europe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The beginnings of American involvement in human rights in the 1970’s signaled the end of a unipolar European human rights era, though for a time human rights became unipolar about the American-centric perspectives, a phenomena that strengthened after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and has only in the last decade seen significant challenges by economic competitors to the United states, most prominently China. The era of American influence saw the demise of what Hopgood describes as European “secular religiosity” and towards the American style of political intervention in the name of defending democracy—where democracy was a thinly veiled stand-in for American economic interests.  Recent examples include American ongoing relations with Saudi Arabia, 1990s support Saddam Hussain in Iraq, and strategic support of torture in Guantanamo Bay.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Americans, even under the most ardent human rights supporter, President Carter, were inconsistent allies to the human rights endeavor: “human-rights violating allies like Iran and Saudi Arabia were just too important for American security, and seen as an important counterweight to Soviet influence, so Carter could not consistently follow through on his rhetoric by threatening to withhold diplomatic support or economic resources from some of the worst violators of human rights” (Posner 18). While the United States generally supported and provided funding for major human rights organizations, they seldom ratified human rights treaties, and only with a raft of Reservations, Understandings, and Declarations (RUDs) limiting the United States’ liability to upholding the treaty.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not that this was likely even necessary. Many authoritarian countries ratified the ICCPR, and other human rights treaties, and although these treaties were designed to be more binding, the same issue of political non-incentive for any particular country to take action resurfaced. Further, the treaties often used vague, sometimes self-negating language, or specified requirements that would be aspirational for all but the richest countries. Article 19 of the ICCPR declares the right to freedom of expression, but in the next paragraph, offers governments a get-out clause:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The gates of plausible deniability in the clause, “protection of national security or of public order.. or morals,” swing wide. The failings of the covenants were appreciated at the time. Pakistani legal scholar, Hamid Kizilbash wrote of the covenants in 1976 that “what is most unsatisfactory about the implementation procedure is the fact that the individual has no role in the preparation of reports. States are not called upon to consult or transmit what an individual group within their territory may wish to have included in the report. No system of hearings, public consultation and individual petitions has been provided for. In the absence of such provisions it is clear that the reports will reflect whatever the government of a state wishes to make known” (Kizilbash 57).

1991-now: Era of American Pseudo-Unipolarity
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union, one might reasonably assume a raft of advances human rights could proceed, over the corpse of their most powerful political opponent. However, immediately following the fall of the Soviet Union, events made a mockery of such an assumption. First, the horrifying genocide in Rwanda, where more than 800,000 Tutsis were slaughtered by the Hutu majority in Rwanda (Posner). The event was made for macabre spectator sport for the human rights organizations of Europe, demonstrating the irrelevance of the now nearly 50 year old Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the commission appointed to advise the UN. The lesson repeated itself one year later in the civil war in Yugoslavia where Serbians attempted to ethnically cleanse Bosnians from the region, shocking Europeans to see genocide return once more in the 20th Century to their own continent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The war criminal trials that followed (the UN was basically immobile during the atrocities) were widely criticized for bias and inconsistency, leading to the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 1998, and official opening in 2002. It has tried few, successfully tried fewer, and those it has tried are exclusively from African nations. The court took 10 years before its first successful prosecution, of the Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. It is also expensive, costing a billion dollars in its first decade.  The United States continues to claim immunity to the court, and refuses to provide funding for the court. Naturally, the court appears mostly irrelevant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to Freedom House, every year since 2005 has seen a retreat in democracy and an advance of authoritarianism. Modern democracy has seen a corresponding retreat of the notion of the public space where facts exist as universal. Propaganda experts in Russia successfully used data, with the aid of data company Cambridge Analytica to spread disinformation about political events in the United States and the United Kingdom leading up to the 2016 election, and the Brexit referendum. Facebook has set new norms for the public dialogue between fiction and fact, allowing disinformation to be spread, while making surveillance easier than ever before (Snyder). Democracy has succumbed to populism in Hungary, Poland, Brazil, and Bosnia in the last decade. Human rights efforts, by contrast, appear to be stuck in the 19th century.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2017 the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights launched their 70th year anniversary campaign. The campaign feature the hashtag, #standup4humanrights, along with a website proclaiming “we can all be Human Rights Champions.” The website encouraged participants to post stories online, on platforms including Snapchat, Instagram, and yes, Facebook, the last of whom there has received no official comment on, or criticism of, by any of the human rights commissions at the UN. “All it takes, apparently, is posting individual stories online and recording an article of the declaration in one’s own language. There is hardly any mention of law or politics; it suffices to ‘promote, engage and reflect.’” (Loeffler)

Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Throughout this essay, I’ve alluded to the differences between revolutionaries’ claims to rights, and governments’ self-justification via an invented language of international law. Hopgood explains the difference between top-down human and bottom-up human rights as follows, “the local and transnational network of activists who bring publicity to abuses they and their communities face and who try to exert pressure on governments and the United Nations for action, often at tremendous personal cost”, versus “a global structure of laws, courts, norms, organizations that raise money, write reports, run international campaigns, open local offices, lobby governments, and claim to speak with singular authority in the name of humanity as a whole” (Hopgood 2). The criticism reflects the conflict of liberal versus the libertarian, in the question, does greater bureaucracy correspond to gains in human potential, or is the growth that of a cancer, whose purpose is not to serve the body out of which it was conceived, but only to grow?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This central conflict plays out while human rights activists engage bottom-up, grassroots endeavors around the world. These countries lie beyond the political purview of the International Criminal Court in the Hague, struggling against the rise of tyranny and nationalism in places like Bolivia, Venezuela, China, and Russia. Resistance movements can only seldom rely on the international bureaucracy to provide the assistance promised in lofty covenants. If human rights organizations had any legitimate influence, the Arab Spring would have been unnecessary, and dictators in Egypt and Syria would have been replaced by human rights leaders. Instead, politicians in countries like the United States and Russia used human rights declarations as pawns to maintain economic interests in the region.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What is unconscionable is that human rights organizations continue to ignore criticism of the failings of the movement. Foreign policy analyst David Rieff wrote of this phenomenon of cognitive dissonance, “This is predictable. If your expectations are millenarian — if you believe there is a right side of history, yours, and a wrong side of history that is doomed to defeat — skepticism about the human rights project, let alone voices of opposition, is unlikely to sway your position” (Rieff). Human rights activists need to justify the unmerited and costly expansion of their bureaucracies. Human rights documents need to have more substantial teeth than the possibility that a commission will enter into dialogue with a violating nation. The failures of human rights organizations are costly not only in price but in their deception: allowing nations to do the bare minimum to defend democracy and free people around the world.
