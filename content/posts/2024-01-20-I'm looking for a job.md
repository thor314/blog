# I'm looking for a job
I am re-entering the zk engineering job market. 

This note's target audience is founders, investors, and recruiters, looking to hire a staff-level zero knowledge engineer.

## Some things I will want from prospective employers:
- I should believe in the founders (and investors):
    - founders' technical and business ability is credibly demonstrated. I should believe that the founders present the capacity for vision that outstrips my own, and that they have a realistic path toward that vision.
    - founder(s)' ability as leaders to manage and support employees clearly outstrips their ego (check this with prior or pre-existing employees).
    - founders should have reasonable, ideally data-based arguments about why the market will favor their product, and how that product will be brought to market.
    - founders should understand, and be able to state, what risks the company is taking and how their management mitigates for risk.
    - investors have legitimate (not pump-dump) and profitable reputations
- I should believe that the  project is technically and strategically interesting, and likely to develop into a credible buisness
    - technically interesting: I should be able to understand the idea technically and strategically. I want to understand advantages and disadvantages, and have a sense that the team will succeed in building the product.
    - unique product: I may build a clone of an existing product if it is personally educational, but not to race to the commoditized market bottom.
    - as an engineer, I should be enabled to learn while building.
- people/culture seem "good"
    - norms for strong interpersonal communication skills and engineer independence
    - high levels of technical competence
    - ops / hr lead is *annoying in the right ways* - advocating for what will make the company stronger, advocates for values, tests process for effectiveness, inserts structure where needed and removes or changes it where ineffective.
- details:
    - my target comp range is between: 
        - \$200k, 2.0% equity 
        - \$500k, 0.2\% equity
        - A note on why I care about high numbers: I want high numbers because I am worth this much. I obviously do not *need* this much, and typically donate 30-50% of my income to organizations like GiveWell.
    - remote-first, or office in SF. Won't relocate.
    - nice to have: subsidizes conference attendance. I have co-organized several zk-industry hackathons, and am likely to continue to want to do so.

## Resume
I don't keep a LinkedIn or a maintain a resume. This is post is my resume.
