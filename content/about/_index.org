As of February 2022, 
I am a cryptographic engineer at [[https://entropy.xyz/][entropy]], a trustless, chain-agnostic custody project. 
I cowrite the cryptography newsletter, [[https://zkmesh.substack.com/][zkMesh]], with Anna Rose of the [[https://zeroknowledge.fm/][Zero Knowledge Podcast]], which I recommend as a plausibly unbiased source for technical discussion in the blockchain space.
I'm currently running a zero-knowledge cryptography study group with [[https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/][Dr. Justin Thaler]], which you may find [[https://discord.com/invite/tHXyEbEqVN][here]] at the zkHack Discord server.

I'm broadly interested in the intersection of cryptography, economic mechanism design, and human coordination. I'm also thoroughly approachable. Say hi on Twitter.
