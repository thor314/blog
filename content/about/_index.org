Hello Internet! You're at the one and only remaining blog of Thor Kamphefner--all other blogs of Thor Kamphefner were hacked (by forward-security-friends), or I stopped paying for them.

This blog is my posting destination for long-form cognitation, rendered fit for public dissemination.  
I'm broadly interested in cryptography, mathematics, system programming, science fiction, economics, and community building. 
Some posts I'm proud of include:
- [a walkthrough of a Distributed Key Generation Scheme from the 1990s](https://thork.net/posts/2022_4_21_dkg/) 
- [an experiment measuring my effectiveness as a programmer, varying implementation techniques](https://thork.net/posts/20211015_how_effective_prototyping_euler50/)
- [my analysis of illusions around Human Rights](https://thork.net/posts/2020_four_floundering_eras_of_human_rights/), originally conceived as an essay for an undergraduate class

As of February 2022, 
I do cryptographic engineering work at [[https://entropy.xyz/][entropy]], a trustless, chain-agnostic custody project. 
I cowrite the cryptography newsletter, [[https://zkmesh.substack.com/][zkMesh]], with Anna Rose of the [[https://zeroknowledge.fm/][Zero Knowledge Podcast]], which I recommend as a plausibly unbiased source for technical discussion in the blockchain space.
I'm currently running a zero-knowledge cryptography study group with [[https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/][Dr. Justin Thaler]], which you may find [[https://discord.com/invite/tHXyEbEqVN][here]] at the zkHack Discord server.

I'm broadly interested in the intersection of cryptography, economic mechanism design, and human coordination. I'm also thoroughly approachable. Say hi on Twitter. 

## Some past things I've used my attention points on include:

- Wrote a standard to enshrine NFT royalties for NEAR smart contracts,
  [[https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/specs/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Payout.md][Boop!]] Note to the
  uninitiated: NFT Royalties on Ethereum are a HUGE pain, and are mostly hacked around by centralized databases,
  which is a pretty problematic solution for NFT creators who might like to ask more than one marketplace
  respect their royalty specifications at a time.
- Paper: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03052][Combining GHOST and Casper]] - coauthored a
  mathematical security paper with my mentor (Yan Zhang)[https://twitter.com/krzhang] analyzing
  the security and liveness properties of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain consensus protocol (it secure, it
  synchronously live, it even plausibly asyncronously live!)
