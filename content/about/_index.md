Hello Internet!

You're at the one and only remaining blog of **Thor Kampefner**, my posting destination for long-form cogitation, rendered sufficiently fit for public dissemination. This about me was last updated Jan 2024, and is irregularly updated. 

I am an independent cryptography engineer and educator. The range of posts you'll find here will generally trend toward cryptography, science-fiction, or other assorted hot takes.

As of Jan 2024, most of my attention is going toward [Pebble Stark](https://github.com/thor314/pebble-stark), my reverse-engineering of the [Starkware Stone prover](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stone-prover/tree/main), which prove the trace of CASM (compiled Cairo) programs.

Also as of Jan 2024, I am looking for a new role! See the bottom of this note for some discussion of what I'm looking for in potential employers.

## Some of my previous projects:
- Built [Uncloak](https://github.com/thor314/uncloak), a fledgling cryptography [wiki](https://uncloak.org/) and cryptography engineering course, aiming to increase the accessibility of cryptography engineering as a discipline for interested software engineers, supported under a grant by the Ethereum Foundation.
- I really like Obsidian, which made it possible for to leave the [Church of Emacs](https://stallman.org/saint.html). In gratitude for my freedom, I wrote an obelisk to Obsidian (a guide), which people [seem to like](https://github.com/thor314/obsidian-setup). 
- Co-organized [ZK Hack](https://zkhack.dev/) [Lisbon]() and [ZK Hack Istanbul](https://www.zkistanbul.com/), a series of zero-knowledge hackathons.
- A Zero Knowledge [cryptography study group](https://github.com/thor314/pazk) with the good [Dr. Justin Thaler](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/), which you can find through [the zkHack discord server](discord.com/invite/tHXyEbEqVN).
- Cowriting the [ZK Mesh](https://zkmesh.substack.com) cryptography newsletter with Anna Rose of the [Zero Knowledge Podcast](https://zeroknowledge.fm/), which I highly recommend as a source for independent technical discussion in the blockchain space.
- Led cryptography engineering at [entropy](https://entropy.xyz/), a trustless, chain-agnostic asset custodian, built with threshold signatures, and the Substrate blockchain building framework.
- Wrote assorted standards for the Near NFT world [most notably royalties](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/specs/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Payout.md). NFT Royalties on Ethereum are a sort of non-standard backwards compatibility issue, and are mostly hacked around by centralized NFT marketplaces, which causes issues for NFT creators.
- Cryptography engineer at [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/), a zero-knowledge rollup Ethereum layer 2.
- Paper: [Combining GHOST and Casper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03052) - coauthored a mathematical security paper with my mentor [Yan Zhang](https://twitter.com/krzhang) analyzing the security and liveness properties of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain consensus protocol (it secure, it synchronously live, it even plausibly asyncronously live!)
- In 2017, Thor moved to the bay, ran the San Francisco marathon, and never did Thor feel the need to run a marathon again.

## Some things I would like to see in prospective employers:
This note's target audience is founders, investors, and recruiters, looking to hire a staff-level zero knowledge engineer with management experience.

- I should believe in the founders (and investors):
    - founders' technical and business ability is credibly demonstrated. I should believe that the founders present the capacity for vision that outstrips my own, and that they have a realistic path toward that vision.
    - founders' ability as leaders to manage and support employees clearly outstrips their ego (I may ask pre-existing employees etc.).
    - founders should have reasonable arguments about why the market will favor their product, and how that product will be brought to market.
    - founders should be able to state what risks the company is taking and how they intend to navigate that risk.
    - investors have legitimate (not pump-dump) and profitable reputations
- I should believe that the project is technically and strategically interesting, and likely to develop into a credible business
    - technically interesting: I should be able to understand the idea technically and strategically. I want to understand advantages and disadvantages, and have a sense that the team will succeed in building the product.
    - unique product: I may build a clone of an existing product if it is personally educational, but not to race to the commoditized market bottom.
    - as an engineer, I should be enabled to learn while building.
- people/culture seem "good"
    - strong independence norms. Startups have too much to do for micromanagement to be a norm. I don't love daily standups, but I can tolerate them if they are well run and efficient.
    - high level of baseline technical competence on the engineering team. Shared velocity is necessary for momentum.
    - Learning and writing on the job is considered part of the role. I like writing. I find it often helpful and clarifying. I write for myself and I write for others, and I would like that to be seen as having value.
    - all ops people are annoying, some ops people are good at it. If there is an ops person, they should be annoying in right ways, advocating for what will make the company stronger, identifying values, testing process for effectiveness, inserting and removing structure where needed etc., so that I as an engineer don't have to always feel that the culture is breaking down but am too busy to do anything about it.
- my target comp range is roughly \\$200k with 1.5% equity to \\$500k with 0.1% equity. A note on why I care about high numbers: I want high numbers because I am worth this much. I obviously do not *need* this much, and typically donate 30-50% of my income to organizations like GiveWell. I care about the work that I do, but cryptography research and engineering for startups is high volatility in terms of positive direct downstream societal effects. Donating is my hedge against that volatility.
- remote-first, or office in SF. Won't relocate.
- nice to have: subsidizes conference attendance. I have co-organized several hackathons around zero knowledge, and am likely to continue to want to do so.
