# Hello Internet!

You're at the one and only remaining blog of **Thor Kampefner**, my posting destination for long-form cogitation, rendered sufficiently fit for public dissemination. This about me was last updated Jan 2024, and is irregularly updated. 

I am an independent cryptography engineer and educator. The range of posts you'll find here will generally trend toward cryptography, science-fiction, or other assorted hot takes. I find writing is seldom paralleled for mind clarification and expansion, and enjoy writing while procrastinating on "real work", to figure out what I actually believe, or just for fun.

As of Jan 2024, most of my attention is going toward [Pebble Stark](https://github.com/thor314/pebble-stark), my reverse-engineering of the [Starkware Stone prover](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stone-prover/tree/main), which prove the trace of CASM (compiled Cairo) programs.

## Some of my previous projects:
- Built [Uncloak](https://github.com/thor314/uncloak), a fledgling cryptography [wiki](https://uncloak.org/) and cryptography engineering course, aiming to increase the accessibility of cryptography engineering as a discipline for interested software engineers, supported under a grant by the Ethereum Foundation.
- I really like Obsidian, which made it possible for to leave the [Church of Emacs](https://stallman.org/saint.html). In gratitude for my freedom, I wrote an obelisk to Obsidian (a guide), which people [seem to like](https://github.com/thor314/obsidian-setup). 
- Co-organized [ZK Hack](https://zkhack.dev/) [Lisbon](https://www.zklisbon.com) and [ZK Hack Istanbul](https://www.zkistanbul.com/), a series of zero-knowledge hackathons.
- A Zero Knowledge [cryptography study group](https://github.com/thor314/pazk) with the good [Dr. Justin Thaler](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/), which you can find through [the zkHack discord server](discord.com/invite/tHXyEbEqVN).
- Cowriting the [ZK Mesh](https://zkmesh.substack.com) cryptography newsletter with Anna Rose of the [Zero Knowledge Podcast](https://zeroknowledge.fm/), which I highly recommend as a source for independent technical discussion in the blockchain space.
- Led cryptography engineering at [entropy](https://entropy.xyz/), a trustless, chain-agnostic asset custodian, built with threshold signatures, and the Substrate blockchain building framework.
- Wrote assorted standards for the Near NFT world [most notably royalties](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/specs/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Payout.md). NFT Royalties on Ethereum are a sort of non-standard backwards compatibility issue, and are mostly hacked around by centralized NFT marketplaces, which causes issues for NFT creators.
- Cryptography engineer at [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/), a zero-knowledge rollup Ethereum layer 2.
- Paper: [Combining GHOST and Casper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03052) - coauthored a mathematical security paper with my mentor [Yan Zhang](https://twitter.com/krzhang) analyzing the security and liveness properties of the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain consensus protocol (it secure, it synchronously live, it even plausibly asyncronously live!)
- In 2017, Thor moved to the bay, ran the San Francisco marathon, and never did Thor feel the need to run a marathon again.
